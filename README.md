# My Data Buddy

My Data Buddy is a promising start-up that aims to help people to keep track and optimize their mobile data cost.

The company wants to provide an API service that can keep track of historical data usage for their registered customers
and give recommendations for optimal data plan based on customers' usage-patterns.

Typically, a mobile carrier in Singapore would offer some data plan packages that have fixed subscription price and fixed amount of free data in GB (1GB = 1000MB). <br>
Any excess usage will be applied additional charges on top of the package's price. <br>
The amount of free data will be reset at the start of every billing cycle.
